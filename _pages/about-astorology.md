AstroOrg does not look at holoscope from simple Sun’s sign. Algorithm looks at the broad range of data and also the registered professional astrologists looks up natal, progress/transit chart to find the right timing and resources to startup the company.

For recruitment, AstroOrg  looks at the founder and foundation date's horoscope and introduce someone who can amend what the founder/company missing in order to reach what the founder wants to achieve.
<h5>Algorithm/Main points that astrologists look at</h5>
<ul>
  <li>MC point</li>
  <li>2nd, 6th and 10th room for founder</li>
  <li>Major aspects towards above planets which are in the above room</li>
  <li>Progress and transit to see the timing</li>
  <li>Synastry chart</li>
  <li>Sabian data</li>
</ul>
The site supervisor appraiser is studying under professional astrologer, Mr. Zephyr. Please understand about the following notes about appraisal and algorithm matching. We will offer our appraisals and matching towards only those who have agreed.
<h5>Notes:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Astrology is not a "covert" but a way of interpreting how the power of the star affects that person, and how that person is masterful of the power of the star.</li>
  <li>Based on the conclusions drawn from the appraisal, what kind of choice and decision making will be up to you personally.Everyone has 100% responsibility in their life. In that sense, astrology is just one of the tools people can use for their decision-making. We can not assume the responsibility to any situation caused by appraisal.</li>
  <li>The soul of a person is reborn. Among them, improvement or descent is depends on the person himself.What has come to light through the scientific research of reincarnation is that before people are born in this world, people are born with the creation of a design map of their own life. We think that what is called blue print is what is displayed in this worldly is a horoscope chart. Therefore, we believe that the fate and luck shown there is essentially the one selected by the soul of the person himself, not the one God or Heaven gave to that person forcibly. Therefore, the appraisal that we do is not a decipherment from the conventional fate-oriented standpoint.</li>
</ul>
