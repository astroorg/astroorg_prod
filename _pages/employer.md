<strong>Foundation date consulting</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to decide the foundation date, we will look at the founder's horoscope and choose the date range when the transit planets access those natal planets from good angles. From that date range, we will remove weekends, void time etc then create corporate horoscopes. Based on which type of industry that the new company belongs and what kind of points that the founder think are the most important, the best date and time will be chosen.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the area of western astrology, cosmic and individuals are supposed to be connected and each planets' placement affect each person or things to happen. We can reduce the amount of life stress or live the life whichã€€can enable self realization by living with the mind to think about the planets and being conscious about the universe's rithm.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A horoscope is an astrological chart or diagram representing the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets, astrological aspects and sensitive angles at the time of an event. Among all the charts, natal chart is the one which represents the moment of the person's birth date, time and location. From this natal chart, you can read each person or entity's quality, tasks to clear, or mission
in life. Each degree that each planet represents has the important meaning.</span>
