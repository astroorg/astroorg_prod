<b>Premise
</b>Western astrology thinks individuals and cosmos are linked and each planet's location can affect individuals or things to happen.By living in a way that conscious of the planet and conscious of the cosmic rhythm, it is possible to reduce stress and to live a life that enables self-fulfillment.

Horoscope is an arrangement map of celestial bodies for appraising individuals in astrology, among which the figure created from the date of birth and time is called the birth map. From the birth chart, you can read the qualities, tasks, missions, etc. of individuals and organizations.There is meaning where each planet is located.

In order to choose the foundation date, we consider the relationship between the birth chart of the founder and the star that operates the current air. Based on the time when the defense from the planet works, excluding the weekend etc, among the remaining candidates we create a horoscope of the company and adjust based on the type of business of the company to be established. It will be adjusted until we are certain about the date and time that seems to realize the most important point that the company is founded for.Please be sure to submit the foundation document within the defined time. If you can not submit it, we will calculate another date and time, so please let us know.

<b>Founders' basic appraisal:</b>

Because the exact birth time of the founder was unknown, based on the major events of life, information on partners, etc, we set the time to 5: 23 since P Mars will match ASC and P Pluto will be 120 degrees to this ASC.

His ASC is matched to his wife's moon.

<b>Personal appraisal:</b>

Moon...Virgo 2 degree（0-7 years old - life's start point）
This moon has the advocacy from Cancer Venus and Taurus Jupiter, I wonder if it was a childhood blessed with money and things, however the direction from parents or senior people is properly done.

Sun...Taurus 27.88 (28) degrees（Development potential）
It is a sense of excitement that you are expecting for sweet romance to be held in a new world, where you get the opportunity to get out of Taurus to Gemini.You believe in driving a new opportunity and being a driving force.

Your intention is to work on the collective spirit of mankind sharing rather than the reality at hand.It has great potential in activities in spiritual, psychological, religious, artistic or public works.In order to confirm your pure intention you need to think alone.

Saturn...Pisces 5 degrees（Achievement point of life）
You will seek stimulation and take adventurous actions.You are good at selling goods with high added value.In Saturn age period (55 - 70 years old) you can receive support from Venus and if you become president, you will also have income.

In life as a whole, there is a connection between people and affection and fun, and work from born out of service spirit leads to income.

Currently it is the period of learning.Because there is a gap in birth time, I think there will be some time around, but since the end of March 2018 you will enter the rising season of luck and the second debut to society around November 2026, as your current career The peak will be around September 2032.By the way, last time you entered the last rising period was around October 1990, the debut was about August 1999, and the peak was around June 2005.I think that it will be helpful to see what kind of situation it was at that time.

From the end of December 2015 to January 2016, whether the area of earning or field of learning, your sense of value must have changed (a change for the next 30 years).

Although it is not perfectly ideal, you will continue to work on what is somewhat similar to what you want most to do in society, and you will seek opportunities for perfect self-realization.It will take time since your ideal thing is not accepted in society from the beginning, but from the vicinity area, you will absorb nutrition and become powerful and gradually will approach towards your ideal activity gradually.You will realize what you want to achieve in the society in the coming three decades.

In the period of 2017 / October to November when you are thinking to establish an organization, advocacy from multiple planets will work so it can be said that it is a very suitable time for the establishment.

Gluco, Inc.
Foundation date/time：Nov 1 17:03-17:13
Please make sure to submit the document and get the stamp within this period.

<strong>Point of Selection</strong>

Venus representing the founder's income and Saturn which represents the public position will be connected to Jupiter at the angle of development and fortune from October 26th to November 5th. We excluded weekend etc from this period and chose the date and time when the horoscope of the new company seems to be able to realize the point the company would like to achieve most.

Sun：Scorpio 10 degrees
People who broke the wall, break through the limit and earn a performance can make presentations sympathetically to similar people in different fields.Ideal ideas and ideas that come out of unconsciousness will be realized.

Jupiter: Scorpio 5 degrees
Degree to challenge a big goal.

Moon：Aries 1 degree
Like the new experience that infants are born.

MC：Aquarius 1 degree (when issued at 17: 07-10)
This will try to universally spread ideals beyond space, not limited to specific places.

There is Sun, Jupiter and Venus in the place to show office and it will be an environment where workplaces or working places are enjoyable.People who work here accelerate the experience a lot, but the purpose is targeted by Libra Mars, and this activity will be poured out to build the social position of this company.
